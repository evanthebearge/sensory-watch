## Introduction


### Current Coding Objectives for Sensory Watch
#### Current Stage: **Stage 1 - Development: *Step 4*** 
##### Percentage Complete: 15%

##### Stage 1 - Development

1. ~~Understand principles behind Arduino & BLE (Bluetooth-Low-Energy)~~ **COMPLETE**
2. ~~Write base code for intial development and test basics~~ **COMPLETE**
3. ~~Adjust code to fit project guidelines: master and slave codes~~ **COMPLETE**
4. **Verify code and fix errors**
5. Have code compile successfully

##### Stage 2 - Testing

1. Wire SEEED on protoboard with respective defintions in the code
2. Upload master and slave code to each SEEED
3. Test features which have been coded
4. Find 'bugs' and features which are not working properly
5. Fix bugs by doing **Stage 1 ***Steps 3-5* until working

##### Stage 3 - Post-Development: Requested Features List

1. Add Connect/Disconnect Alert
2. Add Battery level Alert
3. Add Properly defined button and LED functions
4. Use rechargeable lithium-cell
5. Add an additional watch for 3 total watches: **WATCH0, WATCH1, WATCH2** 

##### Stage 4 - Final Testing / Completion

1. Design Enclosure (3 identical)
2. Fit watches into enclosures
3. Clean enclosures
4. Test product with conditions and real world situations
5. Finish any last steps or required work

##### Stage 5 - Production

1. Tell users about product
2. Explain to users how to wear and use product
3. Allow users to wear and use product
4. Have users test product
5. **Have users successfully use product**
